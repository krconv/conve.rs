            Starting from sketches in Adobe Illustrator to finally getting the site hosted, I've been able to get this project rolling
            in a week. I've tried a few times to create a home page for myself and my projects, and have been very pleased
            with how this site turned out. I've been using Visual Studio Code with Sass and Node.js to develop the HTML,
            CSS and Javascript for the site.

            A few things that I've been happy to have integrated into the site are:
            <ul>
                <li>A photo collage. While it's mostly hard-coded CSS values, I'm glad I could figure it out.</li>
                <li>Mobile friendly. I'm glad that the site scales on phones because that is where most of my family will probably
                    see it.</li>
                <li>No white screens. I've tried a few times to implement a site where navigation doesn't result in the flicker
                    of a white screen, and I think I finally figured out a solution that I like.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>LED Door Name Plates</h3>

            I have an obsession for ECE (electrical and computer engineering) because it is a place for me to control objects in the
            real world using computer science. This year I wanted to use some of the basic ECE knowledge I have recently
            gained to create door decorations for my residents (I'm a Resident Advisor) which could be interacted with.

            After prototyping for weeks this summer, I finally had a design which featured an Arduino-controlled RGB name plate. I used
            a laser cutter, Arduino-controlled LEDs, and RF communication all for the first time to create my dream door
            decoration. Unfortunately, the design was turned down and the fun CS (computer science) aspect was taken out.
            In the end, I created twenty-six door tags with static colors powered by some AAA batteries, each of which are
            now hanging on doors down the hall.
