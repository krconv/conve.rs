        <h3>Stodd C Minecraft Website</h3>

            I created a web interface that allows students to use their WPI account to play on a Minecraft server I've built available
            to all residents in Stoddard C. The goals that I want this server to achieve are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Students can play without needing to buy the game.</li>
            <li>Only a set of students are allowed to play.</li>
            <li>Students can only play as one account; they shouldn't be able to log in as someone else.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This Node.js website serves two purposes. First, it is an interface that students can use to learn about the server
            and register to play. Second, it provides a REST API which can be used by a program running on the Minecraft server
            to check the status of a connecting user and either allow or disallow them entry.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea of letting a set of students come together and play on a server has been an on-going project that I've enjoyed
            over the past year. Specifically with this website, I've been able to implement the following features.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>WPI authentication. I tied the website in with Microsoft's OAuth API to authenticate users with their WPI account.</li>
            <li>Server status checker. The website has a widget which shows the current status of the server and who's logged on.</li>
            <li>Seperated logic. I used the middleware framework provided by ExpressJS to seperate authentication logic from the
                    view logic.</li>
            <li>Quick development. I was able to get the webserver up and running in one day.</li>
            <li>Minecraft registration. Students can choose a username and update their password at anytime using a registration
                    widget available on the site.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>krconv.com Project</h3>
        <time datetime="2017-09">September 2017</time>
        <p>
            Starting from sketches in Adobe Illustrator to finally getting the site hosted, I've been able to get this project rolling
            in a week. I've tried a few times to create a home page for myself and my projects, and have been very pleased
            with how this site turned out. I've been using Visual Studio Code with Sass and Node.js to develop the HTML,
            CSS and Javascript for the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            A few things that I've been happy to have integrated into the site are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A photo collage. While it's mostly hard-coded CSS values, I'm glad I could figure it out.</li>
            <li>Mobile friendly. I'm glad that the site scales on phones because that is where most of my family will probably
                see it.</li>
            <li>No white screens. I've tried a few times to implement a site where navigation doesn't result in the flicker
                of a white screen, and I think I finally figured out a solution that I like.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>LED Door Name Plates</h3>

            I have an interest in ECE (electrical and computer engineering) because it is a place for me to control objects in the
            real world using computers. This year I wanted to use some of the basic ECE knowledge I have recently
            gained to create door decorations for my residents (I'm a Resident Advisor) which could be interacted with.
        </p>
        <p>
            After prototyping for weeks this summer, I finally had a design which featured an Arduino-controlled RGB name plate. I used
            a laser cutter, Arduino-controlled LEDs, and RF communication all for the first time to create my dream door
            decoration. Unfortunately, the design was turned down and the fun CS (computer science) aspect was taken out.
            In the end, I created twenty-six door tags with static colors powered by some AAA batteries, each of which are
            now hanging on doors down the hall.
