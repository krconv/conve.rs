        Hi, I'm Kodey. Along with learning through projects, online classes and industry experience, I also have classroom time studying
        Computer Science at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. I am avid about learning, and have found that the best way to
        chase this passion to try recent technologies and meet new people as often as I can. I have special interests in
        security, the Internet and, more generally, using computers as tools in everyday life.
    </p>

        Outside of my "formal" hobbies I enjoy staying active physically, whether it be swimming, biking or some backyard football.
        If you invite me to a Minecraft world, I will be happy to accept the offer. Lastly, I spend as much time as I can
        with my supportive family, and wouldn't trade family time for anything.

    </p>
