krconv.com Project
===
Starting from sketches in Adobe Illustrator to finally getting the site hosted, I've been able to get this project rolling in a week. I've tried a few times to create a home page for myself and my projects, and have been very pleased with how this site turned out. I've been using Visual Studio Code with Sass and Node.js to develop the HTML, CSS and Javascript for the site.

A few things that I've been happy to have integrated into the site are:
 - A photo collage. While it's mostly hard-coded CSS values, I'm glad I could figure it out.
 - Mobile friendly. I'm glad that the site scales on phones because that is where most of my family will probably see it.
 - No white screens. I've tried a few times to implement a site where navigation doesn't result in the flicker of a white screen, and I think I finally figured out a solution that I like.
