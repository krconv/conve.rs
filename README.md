## Technical Achievements
 - **Quick Dynamically Loaded Content**: I wanted to make the page (the header, footer, and background) load as fast as possible, so I kept the `index.html` file very small. As soon as the `index.html` is finished loading, a Javascript function will make a new connection to the server to load the actual content. This brought the load time down from 20ms to 13ms, resulting in almost halving the time before the page is rendered.
 - **Photo Collage**: I created a photo collage using pure `css`.
 - **Used Sass Compiler**: Set-up and developed using the `scss` syntax and compiler to keep the stylesheet managed and readable.

## Design Achievements
 - **Added a 404 page**: Created a 404 page in case a user makes a mistake with a url on the site. Because there is a navigation bar, the user can recover quickly from this situation.
 - **Mobile Friendly**: The site has three scale points to allow for any modern screen width. This makes the site more usable in the case that the web page is viewed with a smaller screen.
 - **Good Color Scheme**: Used a balanced color scheme which doesn't distract from the main content of the site.
 - **Used Material.io Design Advice**: Used the idea of every layer of the site being in 3D space and added shadows accordingly to help users develop a mental model of the sites build.
 - **Added a Icon**: Added an icon to the page to help the user recognize the site when there are multiple tabs open.
