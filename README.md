Do the following to complete this assignment:

1. Fork the starting project code. **DO NOT MAKE IT PUBLIC.** This repo contains:
    * the server code, `server.js`
    * the `Procfile` that you need for Heroku deployment
    * A starting `index.html` file that you will edit as described below
    * A blank `style.css` file that you will use to style your own content
2. Edit `index.html` to your liking, provided it contains:
    * At least one of each of the following:
        * An [image](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img)
        * A [table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table)
        * A [list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li)
        * An [anchor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a)
    * Proper structure: 
        * Using [div](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div)
        * Using [span](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span)
3. Edit `style.css` to meet these requirement:
    * Use CSS Selectors:
        * ID selectors
        * Classes selectors 
        * Multiple classes on one tag
    * Basic CSS 
        * [Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position)
        * [Font styling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-style)
    * CSS Pseudo Classes
4. Use a decent [color scheme](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) to style your webpage.
5. Test your project on your local machine to make sure that when someone goes to your main page, it displays correctly.
6. Deploy your project to Heroku.
7. Ensure that your project has the proper naming scheme (guide follows) so we can find it.
8. Modify the Readme to the specification below.
9. Create and submit a Pull Request to the original repo.

Design/Usability Achievements could center around making the page visually appealing, typography, etc.   
Technical Achievements could center around novel uses of CSS selectors, building content dynamically, etc.

Note: Please do not push node_modules folder to git. (Do not remove it from .gitignore) If you are using an external library, please add the library in package.json. Heroku loads the library from there. 

Naming and URL Scheme
---

You must use a consistent naming scheme for all projects in this course.
If we can't find it, we can't grade it.

By default Heroku assigns your application a random name.
To change it, follow [this guide](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/renaming-apps).

The name scheme should be `a2-yourGitHubUsername`.

Resources
---

A good resource for general HTML/CSS/Javascript is the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/). This contains all the references you need for front-end design.

A good resource for font would the [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/) project, with hundreds of different fonts to choose from so that you don't have to stick with Comic Sans. Or Impact.

If you want icons, look into [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).

Advanced Resources

*Note that none of these are required for a good assignment, but it's generally a good idea to master a couple of frameworks if you are interested in developing web application in a real environment. As always, you should master the basics first before moving on to other parts*

[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) is a popular front-end framework for building responsive web pages and in general makes your life easier. 

[UIKit](https://getuikit.com/) is another alternative to Bootstrap that you could look into. It is lighter than Bootstrap __and__ supports animation, if that's what you are into. 

[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is an extension to CSS that makes maintaining/writing CSS easier and more fun. You basically write in Sass, and the complier will output a CSS file to use in production. 

Sample Readme (delete the above when you're ready to submit, and modify the below so with your links and descriptions)
